# Mystical Rings

‘Mystical Rings’ is a catalogue web application of beautiful, bizarre and unique rings. It hosts ring collections created by incredibly talented and world-renowned designers such as Pamela Love, Mania Mania, Blood Milk Jewels etc. It is a portal for ring lovers who want to discover one-of-a kind pieces that reflect their controversial and unique personalities and thus it gives them the opportunity to browse, view and discover several ring designs, carefully selected and organised.

Apart from their ability to view several ring collections, users can also interact with the web application by uploading their own personal photos, wearing unique jewellery pieces that they want to share with other unique and alternative people with similar tastes. The only requirement for this feature is that users need to be logged in into the application as super users using their individual authenticated credentials. Normal visitors cannot upload any images, however they are still able to view the users photo collection.

Another interactive facility this web application provides, is the ‘Contact Us’ page where users can complete a form with their personal details and submit their feedback to the website and help its moderators to improve existing areas or build new features.
